The SSC's XID programme is a follow-up and identification project designed to ensure that the potential of the 
<I>XMM-Newton</I> serendipitous survey can be exploited by the community in the context of a wide range of scientific 
programmes. 
Its main elements are a number of complementary sub-programmes designed to obtain the identifications for 
well-defined samples of X-ray sources drawn from selected <I>XMM-Newton</I> fields using optical/IR <I>spectroscopy</I>. 
The programme is also supported by a substantial <I>imaging programme</I>, needed for the selection of the spectroscopic targets, 
but which is also an important resource in its own right given the large sky area and hence X-ray source sample it covers.

One of the principal objectives of the programme is to obtain completely identified samples which can be used to characterise 
the overall <I>XMM-Newton</I> source population sufficiently well that the basic X-ray and optical parameters can be used to assign 
a <I>statistical</I> identification for a large fraction of <B>all</B> the sources in the <I>XMM-Newton</I> 
serendipitous source <A target=blank  HREF="http://xmmssc-www.star.le.ac.uk/Catalogue">catalogue</A>.

The XID programme started in mid-2000. Most of the programme is now complete. 
The XIDResult Database collects together the main results from the XID programme in a uniform way, 
providing access to the individual source identifications and the key optical and X-ray data for each object.

Currently in the XIDResult Database contains 3 key XID programme subsamples, the <B>XBS (XID bright flux sample)</B>, 
the <B>XMS (XID medium flux sample)</B> and the <B>GPS (Galactic source sample)</B>, all of which have been published or are in press. 
The main references for each of these subsamples are as follows:
