The SSC's XID programme is a follow-up and identification project designed to ensure that the potential of the 
<I>XMM-Newton</I> serendipitous survey can be exploited by the community in the context of a wide range of scientific 
programmes. 
Its main elements are a number of complementary sub-programmes designed to obtain the identifications for 
well-defined samples of X-ray sources drawn from selected <I>XMM-Newton</I> fields using optical/IR <I>spectroscopy</I>. 
The programme is also supported by a substantial <I>imaging programme</I>, needed for the selection of the spectroscopic targets, 
but which is also an important resource in its own right given the large sky area and hence X-ray source sample it covers.
</DIV>
<DIV>
One of the principal objectives of the programme is to obtain completely identified samples which can be used to characterise 
the overall <I>XMM-Newton</I> source population sufficiently well that the basic X-ray and optical parameters can be used to assign 
a <I>statistical</I> identification for a large fraction of <B>all</B> the sources in the <I>XMM-Newton</I> 

serendipitous source <A HREF=http://xmmssc-www.star.le.ac.uk/Catalogue/>catalogue</A>.

The XID programme started in mid-2000. Most of the programme is now complete. 
The XIDResult Database collects together the main results from the XID programme in a uniform way, 
providing access to the individual source identifications and the key optical and X-ray data for each object. 
</DIV>
<DIV>
Currently in the XIDResult Database contains 3 key XID programme subsamples, the <B>XBS (XID bright flux sample)</B>, 
the <B>XMS (XID medium flux sample)</B> and the <B>GPS (Galactic source sample)</B>, all of which have been published or are in press. 
The main optical references for each of these subsamples are as follows:

Further details of these and related components of the XID programme are given below. 
We plan to incorporate the additional XID programme component results in the database in the near future.

<!-- 
<B>a) The XID bright flux sample (XBS/BSS/HBSS programmes)</B><BR>
The main bright sample (BSS) catalogue contains identifications for 348 <I><I>XMM-Newton</I></I> sources with 
fluxes > 10<SUP>-13</SUP> erg cm-2 s-1 in the 0.5-4.5 keV band, and identification completeness close to 90% (Caccianiga et al., 2008). 
The hard bright sample (HBSS) catalogue contains 67 sources and has 97% identification completeness (Della Ceca et al., 2008).  
The XBS has also been the basis of wider studies of the X-ray source population, eg. Caccianiga et al. (2007), 
L&ograve;pez-Santiago et al. (2007).
-->
<B>a) The XID bright flux sample (XBS/BSS/HBSS programmes)</B><BR>
The XMM-Newton Bright Survey (XBS) consists of two flux-limited samples of X-ray
selected serendipitous sources at high galactic latitude (|b| &gt; 20 deg): the XMM
bright serendipitous survey sample (BSS, 389 sources) and the XMM hard bright
serendipitous survey sample (HBSS, 67 sources, with 56 sources in common with the
BSS sample) having an EPIC MOS2 count rate limit, corrected for vignetting, of 10-2
cts/s and 2x10-3 cts/s in the 0.5-4.5 keV and 4.5-7.5 keV energy bands,
respectively; the flux limit is ~7x10<SUP>-14</SUP> erg cm-2 s-1 in both energy selection
bands.
The details on the XMM-Newton fields selection strategy and the source selection
criteria of the XMM BSS and HBSS samples are discussed in Della Ceca et al. (2004)
while a description of the optical data and analysis, of the optical classification
scheme and the optical properties of the extragalactic sources identified so far is
presented in Caccianiga et al.(2007) and Caccianiga et al. (2008). The optical and
X-ray properties of the Galactic population are discussed in L&ograve;pez-Santiago et al.
(2007), while the X-ray spectral properties of the AGN population are described in
Corral et al. (2010). Other main results of the XBS project are discussed in
Severgnini et al. (2003), Caccianiga et al. (2004), Galbiati et al. (2005) and Della
Ceca et al. (2008).
<BR>
<B>b) The XID medium flux sample (XMS, AXIS  & XWAS programmes)</B><BR>

The XMS sample contains identifications for 318 <I><I>XMM-Newton</I></I> sources in the north with fluxes > 10<SUP>-14</SUP> erg cm-2 s-1 in 
the 0.5-4.5 keV band, representing a completeness of  >90% overall (Barcons et al., 2007). 
This is one of the largest and most completely identified samples of medium flux sources yet assembled. 
The XMS sources are drawn from the larger AXIS sample (1433 sources) which has been used, inter alia, 
to characterize the X-ray source counts and angular clustering (Carrera et al., 2007) and the stacked spectra 
of X-ray sources (Corral et al., 2008). 
The XWAS sample, which began later, consists of ~1000 spectroscopic IDs of southern <I><I>XMM-Newton</I></I> sources 
obtained with the AAT 2dF.  Selected results for ~100 AGN have been published (Garcet et al., 2007), 
and have been incorporated into other studies, eg. Corral et al. (2008); Krumpe et al. (2008), 
but the main XWAS catalogue paper is in preparation.
<BR>
<B>c) The XID Galactic source sample (GPS/XGPS programmes)</B><BR>
The GPS includes a sample of >1000 <I><I>XMM-Newton</I></I> sources in both shallow and deep <I><I>XMM-Newton</I></I> fields. 
The identification rate is much lower than at high Galactic latitudes, as expected, but the programme has 
already produced a range of new results on the stellar population, &gamma;-Cas analogues and isolated neutron stars. 
The main catalogue paper will be resubmitted in the near future once revisions to the modeling of the stellar 
X-ray population are completed.

<BR>

<B>d) The XID Imaging Programme</B><BR>This programme consists of several hundred deep multi-colour optical images 
taken with the INT Wide Field Camera (~230 <I><I>XMM-Newton</I></I> fields typically in three [g' r' i'] colours 
but with a subset in five [U g' r' i' Z]) and with the ESO 2.2m WFI (~60 fields in BVRI). 
Processing, reduction and quality control of the INT WFC images and object catalogues is complete 
(but some work remains, see below). The ESO WFI images have been processed and reduced, 
but production of photometrically calibrated catalogues faces some major challenges and is not yet complete. 
The Imaging Programme covers over 50 sq.deg. of the <I>XMM-Newton</I> sky and reaches ~2 magnitudes deeper than SDSS 
(with a typical ID rate of 80% in contrast to 50-60% achieved with SDSS). It thus represents a key resource which can 
provide an X-ray/optical catalogue of >20,000 X-ray sources, a powerful resource for extending a range of current studies, eg. 
of distant clusters and high-redshift quasars.
